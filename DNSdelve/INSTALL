These installation instructions are generic but the typical module
will have also its own requirments (for instance, most modules require
a DBMS). See the module documentation.

DNSdelve requires Python >= 2.5.

DNS queries (most modules do them) require the dnspython module
<http://www.dnspython.org/>. Warning, there are several incompatible
Python modules for DNS queries (for instance, PyDNS
<http://pydns.sourceforge.net/>), most of them too simplistic for our
purposes.
We require dnspython >= 1.9.0.

dnspython can be installed by hand but is also in binary packages for
several operating systems (for instance, in Debian, it is
"python-dnspython", on FreeBSD, it is "dns/py-dnspython", on Gentoo,
"dev-python/dnspython", on Fedora "python-dns" etc).

The standard DNSdelve module Utils allows modules to put data in a
DBMS. We use PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/> and you therefore
need a PostgreSQL server somewhere. (We require version >= 8.3,
because of the UUID type.)

To talk to PostgreSQL, we use the psycopg interface
<http://www.initd.org/Software/psycopg/>, version >= 2.0. Again, there
is an existing package on most OS, for instance "python-psycopg2" in
Debian.

Installation requires also:

* Perl development tools for the documentation

DNSdelve uses standard Python installation procedures:

% python setup.py build

# python setup.py install
[The above typically requires to be root.]

[But you can also keep all the files in a directory of your choice
(for instance /usr/local/dnsdelve) and run "./dnsdelve" from this
directory. This is convenient, for instance, for development.]
