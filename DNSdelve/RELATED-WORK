* Patrick Maigron's measures on IPv6 penetration were the original
  reason we started this project
  <http://www-public.it-sudparis.eu/~maigron/>

* JPRS, the ".jp" registry makes for a long time detailed measures on
  IPv6 use <http://v6metric.inetcore.com/en/index.html>

* iis.se "engine", part of their dnscheck tools, allows scanning the
  entire zone to test every subdomain is properly configured, and is
  distributed as free software
  <http://opensource.iis.se/trac/dnscheck/wiki/Engine>

* Everyone one knows CAIDA <http://www.caida.org/> measurements, often
  done with their in-house tool HostDB.

* The IPv6 module of DNSdelve took a lot of inspiration from the
  methodology in
  <http://www.ripe.net/ripe/meetings/ripe-56/presentations/Garcia-IPv6_Real_Life.pdf>

* For DNSSec deployment measures, SecSpider
  <http://secspider.cs.ucla.edu/about.html> is a good example

* The ".cat" registry made measures, too, with a tool (publically
 released) described in
 <https://www.centr.org/main/4590-CTR/version/default/part/AttachmentData/data/GA37%20-%20Ippa%20-%2008-CENTR-Pisa(2).pdf>

* A big set of surveys can be found in
