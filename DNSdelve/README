DNSdelve is a framework to gather information from the DNS zones
delegated by a registry. It loads a list of delegated zones and
queries them for various records.

DNSdelve is optimized for periodic, unattended runs, for instance
from a cron job. Results are typicallly stored in a databse, most of
the time a rDBMS, to allow long-term surveys.

DNSdelve is composed of a generic socle, which handles zone file
parsing and parallel querying of the zones and a module which will
perform the actual queries. Thus, surveying the use of DNSSEC requires
a DNSSEC module (which will presumably ask for DNSKEY records) and
surveying IPv6 deployment requires an IPv6 module (which will, for
instance, ask for AAAA records for www.$DOMAIN). 

In the same way, storing the results is the responsability of the
module. In most cases, modules will use the provided DBMS mechanism,
to put the results into a database.

To actually use the program, providing you have a suitable module, see
USAGE. The documentation of the modules is in files which are
module-specific.

If DNSdelve is not already installed on your machine, see INSTALL.

To develop a module, see APIPLUGIN.
