These reporting tools need simpleTAL <http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/>
and gnuplot <http://www.gnuplot.info/>
You may want to use binary packages shipped by your favourite
operating system (eg. "python-simpletal" and "gnuplot" on Debian, Ubuntu or Fedora)

To generate XHTML files, you also need "xsltproc", "xmllint" and the XHTML DTD from W3C
(for example, on your Debian machine you may install the "w3c-dtd-xhtml" package).
