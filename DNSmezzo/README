REQUIREMENTS:

DNSmezzo use PostgreSQL and you therefore need a PostgreSQL server somewhere
(We require version >= 8.3,because of the UUID type.)
<http://www.postgresql.org/>

To build DNSmezzo, you need header files of postgresql
(eg. "libpq-dev" on Debian, "postgresql-devel" on Fedora)
and libpcap (eg. "libpcap-dev" on Debian or "libpcap-devel" on Fedora).

(We provide the dkim-regdom library, used to extract the registered
domain from a domain name, i.e. foobar.co.uk from www.foobar.co.uk but
ibm.com from www.rd.ibm.com.)

INSTALL:

Just run "make".
Then, you can copy all the files in whatever folder you want.

You then need to create the database, let's say DBNAME=dnsmezzo:

createdb --encoding=UTF-8 ${DBNAME}
createlang plpgsql ${DBNAME}
psql -f ./create.sql ${DBNAME}

USAGE:

To extract (and to store in your DB) data from a regular pcap file, you usually
need to run something like this:

./packets2postgresql -v -p -c "host=DB_HOST sslmode=disable user=DB_USER password=PASSWORD dbname=DB_NAME" /PATH/TO/YOUR/PCAP_FILE

You don't have to disable ssl, but it improves performances significantly and can avoid some weird bugs when inserting a lot of data (see http://postgresql.1045698.n5.nabble.com/SSL-connection-lost-after-long-lasting-copy-command-td1924246.html )
