* Add a COPYING file

* The dkim-regdom lib is Apache Licence v2.0 (which is NOT compatible with
  GPL v2)

* Finalize the domain name type

* Extract more info such as EDNS option codes (for techniques such as
  EDNS0-ping)

* Parse and store the sections Answer and Authority (not obvious since
  they require domain name parsing with compression pointers. And they
  can be huge and take room in the database.

* Change the DBMS to something using "vertical storage" like Infobright 
  <http://support.infobright.com/Support/Resource-Library/Whitepapers/>?

* More reporting
