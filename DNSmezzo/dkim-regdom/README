This is the C dkim-regdom lib: <http://www.dkim-reputation.org/regdom-libs/>

It includes recent representations of the effective TLD list available at
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/dns/effective_tld_names.dat?raw=1
and help to convert an arbitrary domain name to the registered domain name.
If you like to regenerate the effective TLD tree structure by yourself
you can use the script "generateEffectiveTLDs.php":

    php generateEffectiveTLDs.php c > tld-canon.h
